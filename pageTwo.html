              The Counter-Strike series has over 20 years of competitive history
              beginning with the original Counter-Strike. Tournaments for early
              versions of the game have been hosted since 2000, but the first
              prestigious international tournament was hosted in Dallas, Texas
              at the 2001 Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) Winter
              Championship, won by the Swedish team Ninjas in Pyjamas. The
              tournament offered a $150,000 prize pool and became known as the
              first "Major". The final significant update to the original
              Counter-Strike game was version 1.6 in 2003, and so the game
              became known as Counter-Strike 1.6 .2001 Winter CPL Counter-Strike
              tournament. In 2002, the World Cyber Games became the next
              tournament to host competitive Counter-Strike, followed by the
              Electronic Sports World Cup in 2003. These, along with the
              bi-annual CPL tournaments, were the dominate Majors of CS 1.6
              through 2007. CPL ceased operation in 2008, but another league,
              ESL, then added Counter-Strike to its Intel Extreme Masters
              (IEM).<br /><br />
              These tournaments continued for four years. The years of 2002-07
              are considered Counter-Strike's first Golden Age, as the game's
              popularity and market-share eclipsed all others in the fledgling
              esports industry.Valve struggled to iterate and evolve on CS 1.6
              because of its high skill ceiling and gameplay. The Counter-Strike
              Xbox release had limited success as compared to that of Halo and
              Call of Duty. The first official sequel was Counter-Strike: Source
              (CS:S), released on November 1, 2004. The game was criticized by
              the competitive community, who believed the game's skill ceiling
              was significantly lower than that of CS 1.6. This caused a divide
              in the competitive community as to which game to play
              competitively. Valve, sponsors, and tournament organizers were
              advocating for the newer CS:S to be played at tournaments, but the
              large majority of professional CS players refused to play it due
              to its perceived shortcomings.Counter-Strike esports gradually
              decreased in popularity during the late 2000s and early 2010s.
              This was in part due to the fractured competitive scene, but also
              due to the newcomer MOBA genre overcoming Counter-Strike's
              previous stranglehold on the team-based esport market.

              The release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) in 2012
              reunited the competitive community of Counter-Strike, ushering in
              a new era of esports relevance for the franchise. Initially, the
              game was criticized for imbalanced gameplay, poor mechanics and
              bugs. However, within several months the gameplay improved after
              updates from Valve. The advent of video game streaming services
              such as UStream, Justin.tv and Twitch increased the popularity of
              competitive Counter-Strike. On eptember 16, 2013, Valve announced
              a US$250,000 community-funded prize pool for its first CS:GO Major
              Championship; the money was funded through the "Arms Deal" update,
              which created in-game cosmetics that players could purchase. Valve
              also announced that the first Major would take place in Sweden at
              DreamHack Winter 2013. The Valve-sponsored Majors would go on to
              be the most important and prestigious tournaments in the Global
              Offensive esports scene.

              In October 2015, a number of professional esports organizations
              with Counter-Strike teams announced the formation of a trade union
              that set several demands for future tournament attendance. The
              announcement was a publicly posted email written by Alexander
              Kokhanovsky, CEO of Natus Vincere, that was sent to organizers of
              major esports events. Teams that were part of the union included
              Natus Vincere, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, Cloud9,
              Virtus.pro, Team SoloMid, Fnatic, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Titan and
              Team EnVyUs. Teams in this union would not attend Counter-Strike:
              Global Offensive tournaments with prize pools of less than
              $75,000. In 2016, the World eSports Association (WESA) was founded
              by ESL with many esports teams, including Fnatic, Natus Vincere,
              Team EnVyUs and FaZe Clan, though FaZe Clan left soon after the
              league's formation. In its announcement, WESA said it would
              "further professionalize eSports by introducing elements of player
              representation, standardized regulations, and revenue sharing for
              teams". They also planned to help fans and organizers by "seeking
              to create predictable schedules.

              Valve's decisions have a strong influence on the competitive
              metagame. Decisions such as the removal of old maps and additions
              of new maps are often met with criticism, as well as changes made
              to certain weapons' performance characteristics. In 2016, Valve
              was "heavily criticized" for the removal of the map Inferno and
              its replacement, Nuke, in the competitive map pool.The release of
              CS 1.6 in 2003 saw a contentious nerf of the iconic AWP sniper
              rifle by increasing its drawtime. This significantly reduced the
              ability of a player armed with an AWP to simultaneously engage
              multiple targets. The AWP was again the subject of a controversial
              nerf in 2015 when players' movement speed and acceleration was
              decreased while the weapon was equipped. Valve has also
              implemented new coaching rules restricting the ability of
              communication between coaches and players during a match, and
              altered a 15-year precedent by increasing the duration of each
              round and bomb timer in 2015. By 2014, 25 million copies of the
              Counter-Strike series were sold. The game's fan base remains
              strong.
