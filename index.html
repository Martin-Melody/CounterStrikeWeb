              Counter-Strike (also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike or
              Counter-Strike 1.6) is a first-person shooter video game developed
              by Valve. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life
              modification by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before
              Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property
              acquired.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              The original Counter-Strike was followed by Counter-Strike:
              Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in
              March 2004. A previous version of Condition Zero that was
              developed by Ritual Entertainment was released alongside it as
              Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Eight months later, Valve released Counter-Strike: Source, a
              remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series
              to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global
              Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox
              360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on
              Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game
              alongside Valve.

                Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to
                Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were
                acquired by Valve in 2000. The game received a port to Xbox in
                2003.[9] It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a
                beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April
                2013.[10][11]

              <p>
                Counter-Strike was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition
                Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. It
                used the Half-Life GoldSrc engine, similar to its predecessor.
                Besides the multiplayer mode, it also included a single-player
                mode with a "full" campaign and bonus levels. The game received
                mixed reviews in contrast to its predecessor and was quickly
                followed with a further entry to the series titled
                Counter-Strike: Source.[12]

                Counter-Strike: Source was the first publicly released game by
                Valve to run on the Source engine. Counter-Strike: Source was
                initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Caf√©
                Program on August 11, 2004.[4][13] On August 18, 2004, the beta
                was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and
                those who had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some
                ATI Radeon video cards.[14] While the original release only
                included a version for Microsoft Windows, the game eventually
                received a port to OS X on June 23, 2010 with a Linux port
                afterwards in 2013.[15][16]

                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the fourth release in the
                main, Valve-developed Counter-Strike series in 2012. Much like
                Counter-Strike: Source the game runs on the Source engine. It is
                available on Microsoft Windows, OSX, and Linux, as well as the
                Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and is backwards compatible
                on the Xbox One console.
